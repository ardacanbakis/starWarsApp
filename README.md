# Star Wars App
This application is a web application that lists various spaceships in the Star Wars universe and shows the details of a selected ship. Users can search and filter by ship name or model and see the details of a selected ship in detail.

## Live website 

Can be accessed via clicking [HERE](https://starwarsapp-ardacanbakis.vercel.app/)

## How it works 

At the start of the application, a list of spaceships is retrieved using SWAPI (Star Wars API) - The main page lists the ships and search/filter operations can be performed - When the user clicks on a ship, the detail page is opened and the details of the selected ship are shown - On the detail page, the return link can be used to return to the main page.
